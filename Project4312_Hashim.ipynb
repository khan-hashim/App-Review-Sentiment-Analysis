For both Textblob and Vader, I categorized the polarity scores generated by them by using typical\n",

To determine how the sentiments retrieved by Textblob and Vader compare with each other I did some numerical analysis.\n",
        "The avg difference between the polarity scores by the both is 0.258 which is not quite significant as it would not cause alot of review's sentiment to be catogerized differently using our criteria other than the border cases.\n",

        "To look at the coorelation between polarity score and rating given by user with the review we can see that almost 80% of the reviews catogerized as positive by both vader and textblob have a rating of 3 or more. Moreover comparing the rating of the app with overall sentiment scores we can see that almost 10,000 of the total 11,400 reviews are either postive or neutral. and the avg of the all the 5 apps being studied is 4.34 which shows that users are mostly happy with the apps and that is being correctly reflected in their sentiments in the reviews."

Uninstalled will use it again if they fix advertising issues. Update 2023 still aggressive ads ruin the app and coming soon filter doesn't work. App has potential but needs work.   \n",

Also, plugscore doesn't represent the quality of the station because a successful charge rating is 10/10 even if many stations are broken and there was a long wait and/or stations were very slow.   \n",

But it captures every restaurant, grocery, feed store, market, etc which fills up the map and that cannot be toggled off. I can't turn off the map blocking ad banner. I get that the developers need ads to support the app but dang move the ad banner somewhere else or charge me $2.99 to get rid of it. Deleting app. Onward in search of another one.   \n",

Now more recently my description doesn't even show up when you click on my PIN that used to be there for well over a year.

There's 2 charging stations in our apartment garage. One works fine but doesn't interface with the app. I use it almost daily at least 3 times a week, and it hasn't shown me charging since Aug 21st? The 2nd station shows that it's in use and has been that way for months now. No one has been able to use it, so it's an inconvenience. We all have called customer service for resets...etc, but nothing works. When I try to find stations while I'm out and about the map, it show nothing.   \n",

There's a station at my work place that consistently says it's reserved for me through the wait list system, but the connector won't release when I scan and the app fails to display the \"start charge\" option it claims to have. I report this station consistently, but it's never fixed. When I report, the report accepted message says it places me in front of the line, but then shows I'm at the back again instead. If I had any other option at work, I would take it.   \n",

When I plug in my car, the timer starts at 15 seconds, and the time count, which is measured in seconds,goes faster than a second. It's small, but when it's over the course of an 30 mins to hour, that adds up and costs more than it should. kind of a rip-off.   \n",

Took 20 minutes doing all the common sense stuff and couldn't charge my model 3. Thanks to the helpful filter that filters out non tesla chargers but then won't turn on the station if you have your own conversion kit. Awful experience start to finish wants a ton of information that they don't need and a phone verification. Oh and NFC/Google pay doesn't work as a bonus. Real great job. Hopefully they sell network to someone competent.   \n",

They should not be going by the monthly charge because the amount is always different & could only be temporary.   \n",

Overall CPs are the BEST public charging station.Setup my account was easy and charging is easy. Evgo & EA feel like beta products compared to CP... Minor annoying things: just wish the map view was better im not a big fan of the auto zooming. Really want multiple chargers at one location to show as one station on map Seems very cumbersome to have to click on individual chargers at the same location to view info   \n",

ChargePoint includes some of their stations in other apps, like Shell's. But then exclude other stations. They all use the same app and just wrap it in a skin branded for their company, so it makes even less sense to all be seperate. The app is mediocre. Very basic and very unnecessary. No way to even show distances in KM instead of miles. I shouldn't even need to set that, you can geotarget where I am to know I'm not in the US.   \n",

No easy way to enter your location, map is terrible. Looks like it was designed for desktop use? Takes 30 minutes to set up an account and then it doesn't work. Bad network, bad app, would not recommend.   \n",

Doesn't even provide the more secure ssh server. Can only access the device with an app. Doesn't seem to have an option to be only accessible on the local network, and can only be accessed through the cloud. Will become a big security risk when the updates stop, if it's not already a massive security problem. OpenEVSE is less expensive and more secure.   \n",

We can login to the Chargepoint website just fine, but on two different android phones it will not log us in. Talked to support, we deleted the app and reinstalled, confirmed we had the correct app, confirmed that google play store is showing I am located in the right country. Apps simply will not allow us to login, however, if you have to many failure attempts it does lock you out for 30 minutes including on the website.   \n",

This app generally works and allows me to charge my car. However there is often a disconnect between what the app says and what's actually happening with the car. Currently it doesn't show any activity for the last couple of months, even though my car is plugged in right now at a charge point station? And I know I have charged it at least half a dozen times at Chargepoint stations in the last couple of months.   \n",

My issue is the business practice of automatically pulling an additional $10 to fund my Charge point account when the balance falls under $5 is ridiculous in the modern age of banking. Just bill me for what I use (like Tesla) instead of sitting on all of the excess user account funds you require in order to access your service. Much less sleazy for otherwise a system that works.   \n",

You automatically reload $10 when your balance drops below $5 for the first month, then it will automatically reload your average monthly cost, which for me was $60. No email or notification that $60 would be added, just took it straight from my account. There is no way to manually load your balance or to change how much is added, it is all automatic. This system of payment is not user friendly and needs an update. Would be 5 stars if not for this major problem   \n",

Finally found out what was happening. They average your usage then start pulling a monthly amount. This discouraged me from using the app because I'm disabled and do not have disposable income. Average or not, I like being able to dictate and control the amounts I choose to keep on an account. Things happen which do not allow a monthly average charge every month. Disappointed to say the least.   \n",

Meanwhile, Siri and Alexa integration is available. Chargepoint needs to get their priorities in line and deliver on what their customers are asking for. API integration takes 3 months of integration and testing at most so the hold up is definitely business related 'licensing fees, validation, commercials, etc.'   \n",

Gives good information. Charger failed. Replaced. But nearly impossible to clear out old charger information. Had to delete account and start over completely. Not worth it if not connected to a strong wifi. Once I was able to get the new charger up and running by contacting CP by phone, everything works great. Not 5 star because the ONLY way to reset the charger is by calling in. 4.75 stars if they would allow.   \n",

It will steal your money. The app automatically charged your card $10 whenever the balance drop below $5. That is perfectly fine. But then all of the sudden it charged my card $120. I call3d the support and they say there is nothing they can do. The system replenish automatically for the lasf 3 months. I haven't even hVe this app for 3 weeks. And i been paying on each usage. In another word, i got charged twice and I need to suck it up. Electricify America is Free charging.   \n",

I've been using it with NFC through my phone (Galaxy S9+) for 3 years now and I've only ever had a couple of hiccups. Reloading my balance is easy too. The only occasional \"problem\" I have is scanning NFC sometimes launches Google Pay instead of the Chargepoint app. I blame the phone though. Simple fix is to just open Chargepoint and scan with NFC again. Only happens about once a month, maybe less.   \n",

I don't even open the app anymore. I just hold my phone up and the cable unlocks and I'm off. But I don't like the practice of needing a balance on a charge point account though, that seems like such an annoying way to scheme a little more money off the top. Let me just have a card on file and debit the exact amount. 5/5 otherwise.   \n",

Otherwise the app steals your money without permission and won't give it back unless you cancel your account which takes 3-5 weeks. They just want your credit card info. PayPal only works on the website not on the app. When you cancel the account they say if you want your money in a few hours, then add your credit card number. You can't get a refund if it's just Google pay.   \n",

It sometimes works so it's not broken. But I frequently get card not recognized errors. I got a card is because I need it to work 100% of the time. If my phone is dead I'm screwed. I have a physical card for a reason. I can't figure out how to actually add a credit balance to my account. It seems to automatically bill you which is bad. Oh and PayPal is broken. So is \"don't save card info\".   \n",

As of March 2021, there's *still* no way to manage multiple Home chargers in the same account, so you'll need two phones and two separate ChargePoint accounts to manage two Home chargers. In 2020, my utility rates stopped being accurately calculated in the app based on my selected utility plan (I was able to set it manually). I'd also like to be able to enter my own ev range per charge value to get a more accurate miles added calculation. In general, I'm having a hard time believing ChargePoint is committed to single-family residential charging. App (mostly) works for what it does, but hasn't improved since I installed it years ago.   \n",

Still a lot of stations that won't show up in app though. After the UI update to the stations, it defaults to Google Pay when tapping to charge even with the chargepoint app opened in the foreground. Tried it on two different phones (that worked fine the day before the UI update). Now it always tells me that I am using the station without an account and then charges whatever my default credit card on Google Pay is.   \n",

The app automatically deducts money from your account when you reach lower than $5 dollars.(there's no option to turn this off). It charged $40 today which is cash that I can ONLY use from this app now. POINTLESS. PayPal was my payment method which they can only refund with a check. So I had to add a debit card to get my money back... Warning. Use your phones default payment app, this is a headache   \n",

Now tap to pay doesn't work because it chooses the wrong card so I can't use the money in my account.   \n",

I like that it tells me if the charger is free or in use. Plus I can receive a notification when the charger is free. That allows me to get there before someone else or decline if I change my mind. Also you can use your phone with the app installed to access your account as the key cards are flimsy and split open easily.   \n",

My phone has them enabled for the app. I've never seen this app send a phone notification. For Charge point waiting list this is very challenging since text messages and email are slower and harder to notice. Maybe notifications don't work because I'm using ChargePoint exclusively with private chargers.   \n",

              "10153  The new rewrite shows an incredible daftness towards real-world usage. 99% of users like myself just want to start and stop charging sessions with the least hassle, and a lot of us also already know exactly which stations we'll be using most often. The central focus of the app should be a simple start/stop menu with configurable stations. At the very least that should be a tab or side screen. Instead, what we get is a clusterf*** of a widgets-on-a-map app that I'm sure looked amazing in Powerpoint, but which fails at actual usability. All that I want to do is send a simple network request (start session at station X), but before that I now have to wait for a large map to download AND for my device to accurately triangulate my position to within a few hundred meters. All this before you EVEN SHOW ME THE OPTION to get into a start charging dialog (which also doesn't distinguish adjacent stations). Now, since I like to save battery, I usually don't have my phone's GPS turned on, which means I need to specifically enable it just to get this app's most basic functionality to be accessible - functionality that should not be so dependent on the map or at least such a precise location.   \n",

The only way to start the charging (besides calling customer care service) is using the NFC, but most of the NFC readers at the chargers are not working. Another issue with this latest app update is that the biometrics reader not working at all to log back again into your account, you manually have to input your password   \n",

Same thing if you try to skip account creation, so I have no real idea about the app at all, since I can't even get in to see any of it. Hope the chargers aren't just like the app.   \n",

Also, why require so many things in a password? Honestly if it was just signed in permanently and u just needed a 4 digit pin, i dont think there would be any increased incidence of theft/fraud. Too paranoid for a charging app. after all, look at paypal. Your entire bank account at stake, no sign in required. Maximum charging roughly 30 cents per minute... 8 characters, alphanumericspecial etc..not a banking app, but a charge app. Come on!   \n",

Kinda annoying while trying to plan the next stop, then get to the next stop and have forgotten who's phone is logged in to start the charger. Also having the ability to set what SoC to charge to would be nice. But other than that, the app seems to work exactly as intended. Shows me where they are, start the charger with a swipe in the app, tracks charging.   \n",

The app shows 1 available and 12 Coming Soon spots for my location, which is wrong. EA's iOS app and web site show them all as Online, which is right. No ability to stay logged in is annoying. Even a Remember Username option would be nice. If a session fails to start due to charger problems, i have to force quit the app to try again. Overall sluggish response throughout the app.   \n",

Good costumer service! Useless update! I used to get an SMS when my charging was completed, now this option was disabled without notice and I had to pay 20$ extra. Already made the claim for refund. Now The new settings for alerts suck! Why is there a \"fast\" label next to the charge % alert? It only works on fast chargers? Notification options are now flaky and vague.   \n",

I used to get sms and email notifications when the charge was done. Everything is activated but I get no notification except for the new timer notification feature which is not accurate (I set a timer for 3hrs and got it after 3h50). Also, the active charge gets erased if the phone reboots which is also annoying. I find the new itinary feature pretty much useless without android auto integration.   \n",

I can't configure notifications at all, but get none even though they are all selected all the time. My current charging session is often never showed, and it's late if it does. The only thing it does right is show me which stations are in use. Not even sure if I trust it to add funds to my balance. Please update again and I'll update my review.   \n",

        "After looking into the reviews that were classified as a feature request and reviews that were classified as bug report, i have summerized two recommnedation for the developers of the respective apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "1) The first recomendation is for our second Competitor app Charge Point. The developer can implement a feature that allows the user setup for automatically stopping charging after certain amount of kWh charged or time elapsed. This will allow users to only charge how much they want and want to pay at a certain time and do not have to manually stop the charging at the exact moment.\n",
        "The reason this recomendation is being made is by looking at one of the reviews that was predicted as a feature request by our classifier. By looking at the original review text I came up with this feature request as user was asking for this functionality. And to verify that it is still relevant i looked into the current features offered by the app on the google play page and this one is currently not being offered and thus the developer can make this change to satisfy user requirments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2) The second recomendation is for our first Competitor app Plugshare. The developer can look into making the app ad free or atleast reduce the number of ads. This one thing seems to be annoying alot of users and they have complained about it in the reviews so to looking into keeping users of app intact and happy the developers can make an ad free app. The rationale for making this recommendation was analazying the review texts that were classified as bug report by our classifier. Alot of such reviews for this app were complaining about ads on the app and users were unhappy with ads popping up. (The reasoning for considering ads as a bug report was going over the reviews classified as bug in training data set and alot of the reviews classified as bug were complaining about ads)\n",
        "\n",
        "3) An additional recomendation is for our second competitor app Charge Point. The developers can look into editing the feauture that deducts money from customers bank accounts when their balacne in the app goes under $5. The users are also not allowed to set a value for automated reloaded of their balance and a genric amount is deducting. The rationale for making this recommendation was analazying the review texts that were classified as bug report by our classifier. Alot of such reviews for this app were complaining about decution by the app and users were unhappy with this. On the note of payment alot of other bugs were also reported with payment issues not being able to pay using different payment methods."

        "After looking into evaluation metrics for our the algorithms we can talk about the risk and uncertainity associated with the recomendations we have made.\n",
        "\n",
        "The accuracy score of both algorithms are reasonably high and one would assume that we would be predicting a feature requests and bug reports on unseen data accurately and the results can be used to make credible recommendations. However that is not entirely true. By looking into the labelled data set the we used to predict we can see that it was not balanced data set and only 8% of the data was classfied as feature request and 16% was classified as bug report. Using this data to train the model leads to a bias in the model and hence it will tend to predict more values as not a feature request or not a bug report.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result we have to look into other metrics such as precision and recall to see the risk and uncertainity of our models.For our first model the precision and recall scores are pretty low. Precision is ratio of correctly predicted feature requests to total predicted as feature requests.Since this score is low it means that alot of the reviews classfied as feature requests might not actaully be feature requests and we cannot just rely on that to give recomendations.However a fix for that was to manually go over the review texts and verify that the predicted feature requests are actaully feature requests before giving out the recomendations for making the changes. This way the risk of giving an incorrect recommendation was minimized. Recall is ratio of correctly predicted feature requests to the total feature requests in data. The low recall of 0.4 means that alot of feature requests present in the rewiews were wrongly classified by the model and we missed out on potential feature requests. However for feature requests a more important metric is precision since a wrong recomendation can waste alot of time of developers and we were able to add another layer of manual validation to limit this risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for our second algorithm, a low precison means that reviews classified the  as bug reports, half of them might not actually be bug reports. The risk of giving a wrong recomendation to developer in this case was again reduced by manually valiated if its actaully a bug report. But in this case the more important metric was recall. Since we have a very low score of 0.25 it means that approx 3/4 of reviews that were actually bug reports might be classified otherwise and hence leads to alot of bug reports go unnoticed and we are not able to recomend changes to developers that were needed to satify users."

As a trend observed in the labelled data too the reviews are mostly about users sentiment towards the app's funtionaing and featuers. and less reviews are about new features requests. The same pattern is observed  in the review topics extracted from my apps. These topics mostly represent the users sentiments towards the app and its existing features. For example topic 2, 4, 5,6,8 highlight the usefullnes of app in finding ev chargers and their location.These are the functionalities currently being offered by these apps as observed from google play pages. The words like 'useful', 'best', 'easy', 'love', 'helpful' etc in these topics also show the postive sentiment of users towards the app which was earlier highlighted in the discussion of overall postive sentiments of reviews predicted using sentiment analysis.\n"

Even though the number of bugs in training set was low but it was higher than feature requests and again a similar trend was noticed in our apps data and a higher number of bug reports were found. Looking into the topics some of the topics match with the bug reports esp those that were faced by alot of users and there were alot of reviews regarding those.\n",

There are also reviews from other apps as well that were facing problems with payment options.\n",

But in terms of accuracy when properly trained it can provide accurate insight into features and bugs being reported in our reviews.\n",
